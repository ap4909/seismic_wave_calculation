# seismic_wave_calculation
Undergraduate research project, 2011. A python script (wave.py) that can be used for the calculation of travel times and the plotting of seismic ray paths, for source-receiver distances between 30 and 90 degrees, for a cylindrically symmetrical mantle model. 
Usage, abilities and limitations of the program, and some possible improvements, are described in Documentation.doc
